# College Info
Displays university rankings from various sources.

## Data
We used python webscraping to get data from various sources such as The Higher Education and QS Universities.
Using python, we converted and combined the data into a csv file.
App.js, then, reads the csv file and loads information to an array.

## Autocomplete
Whenever the search bar detects a keydown, App.js looks for university names that contains the substring that the user has entered.
To reduce complexity, only first 5 results will be shown based on alphabetical order.

## Responsive Web Design
The web contents are responsive to the window size. Smaller window will result in smaller commponent sizes. 
This was one of the main focus of our web development progress.

## Webpage
The pages were built from scratch using html, with css, javascript, bootstrap. Keyframes was also used to create simple animations
